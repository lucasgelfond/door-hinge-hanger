door-hinge-hanger
=================

The need for this project arose when I got a wetsuit; more specifically an O'Neil wetsuit, as I am learning how to surf.

The wetsuit, when turned inside out advised that to keep it in optimal condition, one should hang it in a cold, dry place.

Unfortunately, there are no places in my house that are cold, dry, and can accomodate a dripping wetsuit consistently. So after trying to find something that might work, I decided to design and print an adapter that could add hooks to door hinges. For me, this allows me to hang me wetsuit securely outside on some hinges that sill allow it to be under an awning and in a cold, dry, spot that will help it last longer. .

I designed this in OpenSCAD. It's parametric, and even has a percent error scaling calculation built in. I'm still working on printing (with an in-need-of-extrusion-help printer) so I can't provide support for that, but I'll get on it later. 

All files for this project are in the "Versions" folder. 

So far, after working on this tonight, I'm on V3. There's no real need to use v1 or v2, but I leave them there as a way to show progress. A changelog is in the CHANGES.md section of the "Versions" folder. 


If anyone wants more formats, tell me.
