door-hinge-hanger
=================

The need for this project arose when I got a wetsuit; more specifically an O'Neil wetsuit, as I am learning how to surf.

The wetsuit, when turned inside out advised that to keep it in optimal condition, one should hang it in a cold, dry place.

Unfortunately, there are no places in my house that are cold, dry, and can accomodate a dripping wetsuit consistently. So after trying to find something that might work, I decided to design and print an adapter that could add hooks to door hinges. For me, this allows me to hang me wetsuit securely outside on some hinges that sill allow it to be under an awning and in a cold, dry, spot that will help it last longer. .

I designed this in OpenSCAD. It's parametric, and even has a percent error scaling calculation built in. I'm still working on printing (with an in-need-of-extrusion-help printer) so I can't provide support for that, but I'll get on it later. 

All old verisons are in the "Versions" tab.

I'm coming back to look at this and it seems like this isn't the best written or best way of doing things ever. I'm considering going back to rewrite this and if I do, it will be here. I'll keep everyone posted.
